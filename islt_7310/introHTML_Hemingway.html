  Hi there! My name is Paul Hemingway, and I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I am a senior pursuing a Bachelor’s in IT while minoring in Computer Science and Business. I have quite a bit of previous web development experience, including two IT courses, along with internship experience. I recently finished a summer software development internship with Commerce Bank! Within this previous experience, I developed or helped developed a few web application projects using various technologies. My expectation for this course is to learn more about the ‘design’ aspect of web development, rather than just implementation. In the future, I hope to use these web development skills to apply to my career, as well as be able to create my own portfolio in the best way to showcase myself. My favorite hobby is music, as I grew up around many instruments. In my free time, I like to lift weights.
