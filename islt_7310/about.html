      <p>
        Hi there! My name is <strong>Paul Hemingway</strong>, and I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I am a
        senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia, pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in <strong>Information Technology</strong> while minoring in Computer Science and Business, and I am expected to graduate in <em>May 2023</em>. My focus is on <em>software development</em>, specifically front end. I enjoy improving the lives of others, no matter how small, by creating smooth user interfaces. My biggest career aspiration is to work for Apple!

        I would describe myself as a slightly introverted yet <em>determined</em> person. I am always willing to work hard and follow all the steps to achieve a goal. My favorite hobby is music, as I grew up performing. Also, when I am not working or doing assignments, I am either in the gym, or watching Marvel movies.
