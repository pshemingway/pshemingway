        <h2>A Look Back</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="first-p">Going into college, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my future. I knew that I loved technology and was decent at math, so I chose Computer Science as my major, though I did not write a single line of code before my freshman year. After struggling to learn C in my first algorithms class, I met with my academic advisor. She told me that because I’m still unsure of what I want to do within technology, I should consider IT instead of Computer Science. The MU IT program covers a broader area, including media technology, cybersecurity, VR, and software engineering. I made the switch. </p>
          <br>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>I was more interested in the “what” rather than the “how,” so I knew instantly that IT was a much better fit for me than Computer Science. Half of these courses still involved coding, and I was still struggling as a programmer. The other half included digital media, network technology, and cybersecurity, all which I thoroughly enjoyed, but did not feel a passion for. It wasn’t until I took a web development course my sophomore year when I realized what I want to do after I graduate. After learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, etc. I realized how much I loved developing software. It wasn’t until Junior year, when everything somehow ‘clicked’ during my Python class, and I became a much better programmer. </p>
          <br>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Now, as a senior about to graduate in less than 10 months, I know my niche. I would like to become a front-end software developer. I recently took on an internship role at Commerce Bank, nervous about whether I would enjoy real-world software work. This role showed me that I did in fact enjoy it. I performed well over the summer and was fortunately given a return offer, so that is my post grad plan!</p>
          <br>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>My career goal is to one day become a developer or project manager for a FAANG company, most desirably Apple. I’m hoping to discover myself and my leadership capabilities over the first five years of my career, so I can decide if I’d like to remain as a software developer or become a project manager and lead teams. I plan on improving my technology competencies until I believe I am qualified to apply and interview for the big FAANG companies. </p>
